      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        MALBUS is derived from the Urdu word "malboos", the plural of "libas" which means cloth/clothing. Our brand was born in 2012 out of a struggle of many Muslim women to dress up with modesty and elegance. We noticed a gap in the market where it was hard to find clothing that was elegant, on-trend, and above all, modest.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to a sahih hadith: "Jabir reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 'Verily, Allah is beautiful and He loves beauty'." Allah has made modesty the crown of a Muslim woman. The purpose of MALBUS is to enlighten Allah's message and spread positivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to create a world where every woman feels comfortable and confident. We strive to inspire women to always feel confident and empowered by their decisions to choose modest wear, and we provide a wardrobe of their dreams.
